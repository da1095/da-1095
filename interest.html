        I am a student. I am currently studyingat Seneca College Newnham campus, but beacuse of covid, my classes are online. 
        That actually sucks because as someone who gave his classes offline, its hard to adapt to the new normal. But that apart
        I like to watch anime, play video games and sometime sports too. I like watching sports like basketball and football (soccer)
        and sometimes cricket.

        Subtitles are captions displayed somewhere on the screen that translate foreign language. Whether or not an anime has 
        subtitles has proven its importance amongst its western fans. Anime is Japanese made so for other countries like the 
        United States to be able to watch it without any prior knowledge of their spoken language it must either have subtitles 
        added in or translate the japanese to the native language of said group by recording also known as dubbing. Many people 
        in the western culture begin by watching dubbed anime as children then eventually transition to watching subbed. With so 
        many who belong to opposing sides this led to disagreements to which is better, anime subbed or English dubbed. 
        This disagreement led to a sub group  within the anime community known as the purist, purist are fans that only 
        watch subbed anime. These fans are often known to belittle dubbed viewers on a variety of different points that 
        make dubs inferior. Many of these claims actually manage to carry some weight, such as dubs changing the meanings of 
        entire situations, changing the animation to remove what they consider explicit and removing scenes, that cause choppy 
        character development. Needless to say that the experience between the two groups must be vastly different. The claims 
        made by the the purist audience is true Anime with subtitles is more beneficial to the anime community than English 
        dubbed anime. Manga and anime are a huge part in American and the Japanese culture. Anime and Manga were once used for war, 
        propaganda, and recruitment, but is now used for entertainment and leisure. Anime was not just created by one man but by 
        many working together. Anime has had a long line of history causing it to become more and more loved throughout the years. 
        It not only caused Japan a great deal of money and working jobs but it also influenced more people to see the brighter things 
        in life. Manga was not only just important in anime’s history but it was the cause of it. The time line of huge success in 
        anime started in 1914 with the first manga being created.

        Sports occupies a vital role in our lives. It keeps us fit, healthy and makes us active. The secret to having a healthy and 
        positive lifestyle is to have a positive mind and body. Sports is one such activity which helps us in maintaining a proper 
        physique and a positive mentality.Apart from keeping a healthy body and mind, sports also helps us in alerting our senses, 
        keeps us aware and an undaunting personality and outlook on life. Hence, sports has a multi-faceted role in our lives. 
        Students in schools are asked to write essays on the topic of sports for their exams and assignments. For their convenience, 
        we have provided sample essays on the subject. There are numerous advantages of involving oneself in sports. First and 
        foremost, as known by all and very definitively, competitions increase the physical fitness of an individual. Additionally, 
        sports also contribute to building stable mental well-being of a person. Various researchers show that people who are in 
        the daily practice of sports in any form record better mental as well as physical health. Moreover, sports also eliminates 
        the risk of a person catching diseases or facing any bodily interruptions. Competitions increase immunity and increase 
        people’s stamina. Sports also influence the life expectancy of people, increasing the potential years to live of an average 
        human individual. All of us are associated with games somehow or the other in our lives. While at schools and as kids, 
        we were exposed to sports in various forms. However, since many institutions do not make it obligatory to pursue sports 
        in higher academics, some of us are dissociated from its practice. However, a lot of people take up games further, on their 
        own accord. Some people even decide on pursuing a career in the field.A lot of people take up a lot of different kinds of 
        sporting activities. There are many outdoor sports; these include cricket, badminton, football, hockey, volleyball etc. 
        Indoor sports such as various board games, table tennis, chess etc. are also popular. One can choose from a large variety. 
        While outdoor sports contribute heavily in building the physical aspect of one’s being, indoor games have a more 
        psychological impact. However, none of the activities can be categorised in a hard and fast way. Every sporting 
        activity contributes to the well- being of a person, both physically and mentally.
